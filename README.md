#GO enrichment analysis for LCM data

##Description
This is my ongoing GO enrichment analysis for the Laser Capture Microdissection project I am currently undertaking. All analysis are run in seperate folders with requisite data in root directory.  All analysis were run with the skeleton_GO.Rmd script in the root directory.  Each analysis that was undertaken results in tables of GO terms enriched between the regions of interest and a .Rmd report on the specifics of results for each analysis.
